# Float4096
Python module designed for high-precision numerical computations, integrating with numpy for array operations and base4096 for encoding. It includes a Float4096 class for scalar operations, a Float4096Array class for NumPy-compatible array operations, and a GRAElement class which adds to traditional float functionality.
