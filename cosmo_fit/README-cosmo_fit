The sample script exhibits a good use case for Float4096.  This script is designed to find a close approximation of known constants, both in the macro and the micro.  It will then graph them.  If everything is working correctly, this script should complete in about 5-6 hours on a typical machine.

After ensuring all prerequisites are installed, run cosmo_fit.py using python.

 ```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

 ```bash
py cosmo_fit.py

The requirements file is located in the main folder, if you see this it's because you skipped passed our readme!

 ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


# Note: If base4096 is not available on PyPI, install it from source:
 ```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ZCHGorg/base4096.git
